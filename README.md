# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains code, projects, and notes related to fundamental Python concepts. The project is structured to guide you through basic to intermediate Python topics with examples, mini-projects, and notes for easy understanding.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### 1. Code

This folder includes Python scripts covering various topics in a step-by-step manner.

- **01.py**:  
  - Variables & Data Types  
  - Taking input from the user  
  - Type conversions  
  - String methods  
  - Usage of the "in" keyword

- **02.py**:  
  - Arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, /, %, **)  
  - Shortcuts  
  - Operator precedence  
  - Logical operators

- **03.py**:  
  - Conditional statements  
  - Mini project: Simple calculator using if-else ladder

- **04.py**:  
  - `range()`, `while` loop, and `for` loop

- **05.py**:  
  - Lists  
  - Accessing lists using `for` and `while` loops

- **06.py**:  
  - `break` and `continue` statements

- **07.py**:  
  - Tuples  
  - Sets  
  - Dictionaries

- **08.py**:  
  - Functions  
  - User-defined functions

### 2. Projects

This folder includes small projects to practice Python skills and apply concepts in real-world scenarios.

- **Chatbot**:  
  A simple chatbot that interacts with users based on a predefined dictionary of questions and answers. The user can ask various questions, and the chatbot will respond accordingly.  
  - Features: Basic question-answer interactions, exit by typing "quit".

- **Language Translator**:  
  A program that translates input text into a specified language using the `googletrans` library.  
  - Features: Input text, select target language, get translated text.

- **Number Guessing Game**:  
  A fun game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The game provides hints (too high, too low) until the correct number is guessed.  
  - Features: Random number generation, user guesses, and feedback on each guess.

- **Sentiment Analyzer**:  
  This project uses the `TextBlob` library to analyze the sentiment of a piece of text, returning the polarity (positive/negative) and subjectivity (personal/objective).  
  - Features: Input text, analyze sentiment, and output results.

### 3. Python (Notes)

Contains additional resources in the form of PDF notes to reinforce the understanding of concepts covered in the code.
